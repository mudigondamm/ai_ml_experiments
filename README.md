MGT_6203 project: Impact on Gun Industry Company Stock Returns after Mass Shooting

Abstract:Recent decades have witnessed a series of high-profile mass shootings throughout the United
States. While most homicides receive little attention from the public, mass shooting incidents are
extremely salient. Since mass shootings are random occurrences, we want to estimate their
impact on gun manufacturerâ€™s stock. Specifically, we want to see the trend of gun manufacturer
stock performance after mass shootings.

It is expected that gun manufacturers will be affected by the response of these events. It is not
clear what is the impact on the share price and return of those companies. Financial
organizations and some shareholders are not supporting those companies, and some people are
demanding changes in the legislation. However, it appears that some people respond to mass
shootings by buying more guns, so gun sales are increasing.
